August 2
received new data files from Meng. These have the Spu* annotations instead of the mix that they were before.
Redo code to import these. Files are names 'data_spu*'

get different annotation file. "ShewW3181_annots_042513.csv" from xls file

at finishing,
all looks good for now
some outputs:
> cor(Lactate_CC , Shew_HL_HO2)[1] 0.9693649> cor(Lactate_CC,C_lim_CC)[1] 0.3958515> cor(Shew_HL_HO2,C_lim_CC)[1] 0.40397

don't know whether he would expect this.
do some qa before sending it to him on monday 

scatter plot done in ggplot2, will work on putting this in code next time
-----------------------------

Checked above correlations with raw .xls file. Match up. Corrleations very close which means that the normazlaition is very close.

Add fold change calculations to output for alex and check that annotations are correctly matched. 

do fold change calc. then add annotations. need to make any zero value to .1

finished all. 
Summary
final R output is put in "output" folder. This will require some polishing.
1. rename with "Report' then date
1.5 save in Reports folder as .xls
2. polishing: get rid of data with no IDs
3. show less decimals
4. color code sections
5. add cover sheet
6. add spaces and justifications to make pretty
(fixed the way the data was divided a couple of places in fold.chage.R code)
_______________________

wrote some code to filter based on total counts (to get rid of low count genes) and also to see only genes that are regulated 2 fold or more (+/-) in at least 1 comparison.
so far this is just an add on to already outputted data, but could put it in workflow easily.
is called 'filter.R'
------------------------
8/19/13- copied project from Belieav_RNA_proj_temp to here to adapt for diff organism

have new dataset to analyze 

these are syn7002 data, so need to use diff annotations.
first save .xls file. then split into csv for each sheet in .xls file.
need to match names up also, num to sample conditions
Beleav_080213_AB_3_1_Highlight_highO2.csv
Beleav_080213_AB_3_2_lowlight_highO2.csv
Beleav_080213_AB_3_3_lowlight_lowO2.csv
Beleav_080213_AB_3_4_HighLight_low02.csv
Beleav_080213_meng.xlsx--original

fixed all places that were specific to this dataset. At some point would be nice to automate that part. Would need to read in file names and carry the labels around.

copied this project from Belieav_syn.. project to use for analysis of Syn data in coculture conditions.
use .xlsx files for data import, utilize xlsconnect
create munge code 'xls_import'
works good to parse each .xlsx file. next will need to fit into normalization workflow
